    Since , it's a premium question, here is the description below :
    Description
     Imagine you have a special keyboard with the following keys:
      Key 1: (A): Print one 'A' on screen.
      Key 2: (Ctrl-A): Select the whole screen.
      Key 3: (Ctrl-C): Copy selection to buffer.
      Key 4: (Ctrl-V): Print buffer on screen appending it after what has already been printed.
      Now, you can only press the keyboard for N times (with the above four keys), find out the maximum numbers of 'A' you can print on screen.
      
      Example 1:

      Input: N = 3
      Output: 3
      Explanation: 
      We can at most get 3 A's on screen by pressing following key sequence:
      A, A, A

      Example 2:

      Input: N = 7
      Output: 9
      Explanation: 
      We can at most get 9 A's on screen by pressing following key sequence:
      A, A, A, Ctrl A, Ctrl C, Ctrl V, Ctrl V

      Note:
      1 <= N <= 50
      Answers will be in the range of 32-bit signed integer.

How to approach this question ?
/*
    Let, N = 7;
    We keep ctrlA, ctrlC, ctrlV in hand to paste all characters
    So, we have kept 3 operatiosn out of 7 for above.
    So, we have N = 7-3 = 4 operations
    Let's take 4 A's and see what we get
    AAAA = 4 times key_1 (we are left with 3 operations that we planned)
    So, lets F(4) = 4
    AAAA + ctrlA + ctrlC + ctrlV
    or, F(4) + ctrlA + ctrlC + F(4) = AAAAAAAA (8 A's) = F(4) * 2
    -----------------------
    What if we took 3 As in the beginning
    AAA + ctrlA + ctrlC + ctrlV = 6 steps
    Now,we are left with onyl one more step.
    So, we do ctrlV one more time
    We finally get
    AAA + ctrlA + ctrlC + ctrlV + ctrlV
    or, 
    F(3) + ctrlA + ctrlC + F(3) + F(3) = F(3) * 3
    -----------------------
    What if we took 2 As in the beginning
    AA + ctrlA + ctrlC + ctrlV = 5 steps
    Now,we are left with onyl 2 more steps.
    So, we do ctrlV two more times
    We finally get
    AA + ctrlA + ctrlC + ctrlV + ctrlV + ctrlV
    or, 
    F(2) + ctrlA + ctrlC + F(2) + F(2) + F(2) = F(2) * 4
    
    -----------------------
    Similarly, 
    F(1) + ctrlA + ctrlC + F(1) + F(1) + F(1) + F(1)  = F(1) * 5 
    
    We choose the max of them i.e. F(3) * 3 = 9 As
    
    
    So ans=f(n)=max(2*f(n-3) ,3*(f(n-4) , 4*f(n-5) ,......   .... , (n-2)*f(1))

As the number of Aâ€™s become large, the effect of pressing Ctrl-V more than 3 times starts to become insubstantial as compared to just pressing Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V again. So, the above code can be made more efficient by checking the effect of pressing Ctrl-V for 1, 2, and 3 times only.


// A Dynamic Programming based C++ program to find maximum
// number of A's that can be printed using four keys
 
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
 
// This function returns the optimal length string for N keystrokes
int findoptimal(int N)
{
    // The optimal string length is N when N is smaller than 7
    if (N <= 6)
        return N;
 
    // An array to store result of subproblems
    int screen[N];
 
    int b; // To pick a breakpoint
 
    // Initializing the optimal lengths array for uptil 6 input
    // strokes.
    int n;
    for (n = 1; n <= 6; n++)
        screen[n - 1] = n;
 
    // Solve all subproblems in bottom-up manner
    for (n = 7; n <= N; n++) {
 
        // for any keystroke n, we will need to choose between:-
        // 1. pressing Ctrl-V once after copying the
        // A's obtained by n-3 keystrokes.
 
        // 2. pressing Ctrl-V twice after copying the A's
        // obtained by n-4 keystrokes.
 
        // 3. pressing Ctrl-V thrice after copying the A's
        // obtained by n-5 keystrokes.
        screen[n - 1] = max(2 * screen[n - 4],max(3 * screen[n - 5],4 * screen[n - 6]));
    }
 
    return screen[N - 1];
}
 
// Driver program
int main()
{
    int N;
 
    // for the rest of the array we will rely on the previous
    // entries to compute new ones
    for (N = 1; N <= 20; N++)
        printf("Maximum Number of A's with %d keystrokes is %d\n",
               N, findoptimal(N));
