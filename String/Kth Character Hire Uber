You are given two strings S and T. An infinitely long string is formed in the following manner:

Take an empty string
Append S one time.
Append T two times.
Append S three times.
Append T four times.
and so on, appending the strings alternately and increasing the number of repetitions by 1 each time.

You will also be given an integer K, you need to tell the Kth Character of this infinitely long string.

Sample Input:
S = "a", T = "bc", K = 4

Sample Output:
b

Sample Explanation:
The string formed will be "abcbcaaabcbcbcbcaaaaa...". So the 4th character is "b".

[execution time limit] 1 seconds (cpp)

[input] string s

The first string. 1 <= len(S) <= 100

[input] string t

The second string. 1 <= len(T) <= 100.

[input] integer64 k

The integer K, as above.
1 <= K <= 10^16

[output] char

The kth character of the infinitely long string formed.

s1 = 'a'
s2 = 'bc'
k = 600

counter1 = 1
counter2 = 2
while(k>0):
 if k > counter1 * len(s1):
    k = k - counter1 * len(s1)
    counter1 += 2
    if k > counter2 * len(s2):
     k = k - counter2 * len(s2)
     counter2 += 2
    else:
     temp_str = counter2 * s2
     print (temp_str[k-1])
     break
  else:
    temp_str = counter1 * s1
    print (temp_str[k-1])
    break
